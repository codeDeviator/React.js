## Some terminologies you should know before starting documentation
- Library : A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks
- UI : User Interface means the things which user sees when he/she opens the Web app
- Rendering : Rendering in React refers to the process of generating the user interface (UI) that the user sees on the screen based on the state and data of the application
- Single Web Page application : A Single Page Application is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring a full page reload.
- Asynchronous : Asynchronous means that some tasks can start, and you don't have to wait for them to finish before moving on to other tasks
- Jsx : JavaScript Xml is a syntax extension for javascript in react where we can write html code within javascript making code look more clean and readable  
- Components: The building blocks of a React application. Components can be functional or class-based.

## Some technologies you should know before starting documentation  
Before diving into React, it's beneficial to have a solid grasp of several foundational technologies. Here are some key ones:

- HTML and CSS:

   HTML: Know how to structure web pages and utilize HTML tags effectively.  
   CSS: Understand styling, layout techniques, and responsive design to enhance the appearance of your web pages.  

- JavaScript (ES6+):  

   Basics: Be familiar with variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and events.    

Advanced Concepts:  

- ES6+ Features: Learn about arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, spread/rest operators, and classes.  
- Modules: Understand import and export statements for modular coding.  

- JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries (optional but helpful):  

   Basic knowledge of libraries like jQuery or frameworks like Angular or Vue can provide context for how React fits into the 
   broader front-end development ecosystem.  

- Node.js and npm:  

   Node.js: Understand the JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser.  
   npm (Node Package Manager): Learn to manage dependencies, run scripts, and comprehend package.json.  

- Version Control Systems:  

   Git: Know the basics of version control, including creating repositories, committing changes, branching, merging, and 
   pushing to remote repositories like GitHub.  

Familiarity with these technologies will give you a strong foundation, making your journey with React smoother and more efficient.  

## Introduction to React
ReactJS, also known as React, is a popular front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.  

![facebook-1024x542](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15cafbeb-52a5-4d6b-9023-8c80063acd26)

## Advantages of React
### It is composable  

Composition is a function of combining parts or elements to form a whole. In the old days of web development, a website was usually a single HTML page. So, a lot of time those web pages ended up being very long with thousands of lines of HTML codes. With modern frameworks like React, we can divide these codes and put it in custom components. Then we can utilize these components and integrate them into one place. Hence the code becomes a lot more maintainable and flexible. 
### Easy to Learn

ReactJS is easy to learn and use. A lot of documentation, tutorials, and training resources are available on the internet. Any developer who comes from a JavaScript background can easily understand and start creating web apps using React in a few days.

### Reusability

Reusability means that we can reuse the same components in multiple different places within your project.

### Flexibility

Flexibility in React means the code is easier to work with and update because it's built in small, separate pieces called components. This makes React code easier to understand and maintain compared to other frontend frameworks.
### It is declarative  

In react the DOM is declarative. We can make interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and React takes care of updating the DOM according to it. This means we never interact with DOM
### Single Web Page Application

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. This approach aims to provide a more fluid and responsive user experience, similar to that of a desktop application.


## Getting Started with React  
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. Below is a detailed guide on how to get started with React, including installation, prerequisites and the basic steps to create your first React application.


## Installation

To begin using React, you'll need to configure your development environment. The simplest method is to use Create React App, a tool that initializes a new React project with an optimal default setup. This tool handles the configuration for you, allowing you to focus on writing code. With Create React App, you get a ready-to-use project structure, development server, and build scripts, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.  

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/) - React requires Node.js for building and running your application.
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) - This comes bundled with Node.js and helps manage dependencies.
- **Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - Visual Studio Code(preferred).

### Steps

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - Download and install Node.js in linux with help of this command
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```
   - After downloading Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install Create React App**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-app (You can use any name for your directory instead of my-app just replace my-app with that name)
     ```
     This command creates a new directory called `my-app` with a default React project setup.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   - Change to the newly created directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-app  (Here we use cd to enter the directory . To go out of directory use cd..)
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     ![welcome-to-react](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43eeff46-2542-46a0-872e-f15aa856a65c)

     Your new React application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (port number can change if port 3000 is busy with some other content)  
     You will see a react logo in browser . Below is the Screen Shot for the webpage which you will see 
<img src="/assests/screenshot_myfirstreact.png" alt="" style="width:50" /> 

5. **Folder Structure of a simple React Project**
<img src="./assests/folder1.PNG" alt="" style="width: 40%;"/>

## Hello World

Let's create a simple "Hello World" component to get a feel for how React works.

### Steps to Write Hello World 

1. **Open Your Project in a Code Editor**:
   - Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to open the `my-app` directory.

2. **Edit `src/App.js`**:
   - Replace the content of the `src/App.js` file with the following code:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';

     function App() {
       return (
         <div>
           <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
         </div>
       );
     }

     export default App;
     ```

3. **Run Your Application**:
   - If the development server is not already running, start it by running `npm start` in your terminal.
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

## Core Concepts of React  

### Components
Components can be considered as building blocks by which different parts of user interface is built for example : button , navbar etc
Componets are independent and reusable bits of code 
There are 2 types of React componets -

- Functional Components
Functional components are JavaScript functions that return React elements. They are used to build parts of the user interface in a React application. They may or may not recieve data as paramaeters 

**Note**  :- The functional component is also known as a stateless component because they do not hold or manage state.

Example -
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// This is a functional component named Counter
function Counter() {
  // Declare a state variable named 'count' with an initial value of 0
  // useState is a hook that returns a stateful value and a function to update it
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // The return statement defines the component's UI
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display the current count */}
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      {/* When the button is clicked, update the count state */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- Class based Components 
React Class Components are JavaScript classes that extend React.Component. They define the UI, manage state, and handle events within your application. Unlike functional components, which are based on function syntax, class components follow the traditional class-based approach.
After introduction of React Hooks use of class components has decreased because react hooks makes the code look clean and syntax is easy to understand
The render() method in react class components returns JSX elements describing the UI of the Application.

Example -
```jsx 
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// Define a class-based component by extending React.Component
class Counter extends Component {
  // Constructor method to initialize state
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // Call the superclass constructor
    // Initialize the state with a count property
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  // Method to handle incrementing the count
  increment = () => {
    // Update the state using setState
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1,
    }));
  };

  // Method to handle decrementing the count
  decrement = () => {
    // Update the state using setState
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count - 1,
    }));
  };

  // The render method returns the JSX to be rendered
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Display the current count */}
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        {/* Button to increment the count */}
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
        {/* Button to decrement the count */}
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Export the component to be used in other parts of the app
export default Counter;
```

### JSX 
JSX stands for javascript XML and it allows us to write HTML in react 
So basically it converts HTML into React elements 

**Example 1**
```jsx
const myElement = (
  <div>
    <p>This is a react documentation</p>
    <p>It is written by Aryan Mamania</p>
  </div>
);
```

**Example 2**
Write "Hello" if x is less than 10, otherwise "Goodbye":
```jsx
// Import React
import React from 'react';

// Define the functional component
function App() {
  // Define the variables and logic
  const x = 5;
  let text = "Goodbye";
  if (x < 10) {
    text = "Hello";
  }

  // Create the element to be rendered
  const myElement = <h1>{text}</h1>;

  // Return the element to render it
  return (
    <div>
      {myElement}
    </div>
 
  );
}

// Export the component as default
export default App;

```


### Props
Props is short for properties and are used to pass data from one component to another . Props are similiar to function arguments and are passed to components in same was as arguments are passed in a function .  
The child component can't modify the props it recieves and can only read and use the props  

Example using Props-
App.js File (Parent class where we will define Props)
```jsx 
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';


function App() {
  
  const userName = 'Mamania';  // This is the data we want to pass to the child component
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name={userName} />  {/* Where Props is userName */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
Greeting.js file (Child component where we will pass the Props)
```jsx  
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  // Access the name prop from the props object
  const { name } = props;

  // Use the name prop to display a greeting message
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```
OutPut -
```jsx
Hello, Mamania!
```

## State Management   

### State
State in React is like an object that stores information about the current state or state of your component. In easy words we can say how it is actually looking like in a given point of time . This information may change over time, and React will update the feature to reflect the latest information.  

- State as a Data Store: Each React component can have its own state, which stores dynamic information that the component can use and display.  

- Accessing State: In class components, you access the state using "this.state".  

- Changing State: When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to show the new state.   

### State Management 
Changing State is a part of State Managmenet which allows state to maintain and update state accordingly . For example in a task management app when we add a task , a task is added and is considered as a change of state or state management . 
State management helps in making the webpage look dynamic .
We can change the component state by using the setState() method and passing a new state object as the argument
In React, state management can be managed within components using 'useState' hook for functional component or 'this.state' for class component .  

- Example of Functional Component with State Management   
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {     //we made a functional called counter
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);   // count is initial state and setCount is state after changing state and initital state is 0  

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button> 
        </div>
    );
}
```
In this above code whenever the button will be clicked it's count will increase by 1 number. 

- Class Component with this.state
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// Define a class component named Counter
class Counter extends Component {
    // Constructor method to initialize state
    constructor(props) {
        super(props); // Call the parent class's constructor
        this.state = { count: 0 }; // Initialize state with a count property set to 0
    }

    // Arrow function to handle incrementing the count
    increment = () => {
        // Update the state with the new count value
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    }

    // Render method to define what the UI looks like
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                {/* Display the current count */}
                <p>{this.state.count}</p>
                {/* Button to trigger the increment method on click */}
                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Counter;
```
The above code will also do same thing . When the button will be clicked it will increase the value by 1 number . Initial State is 0

**Note**
- useState is used in class component 
- this.state is used in functional component

## Event Handling 

### Event   
An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of user action or system generated event . For example a mouse click event which is written as `onClick event`  
It captures and responds to user actions within application.

React uses different ways to handle event 
Some of The most common event handling techniques are 
 1) Mouse Events:
- onClick : Triggered when an element is clicked .
- onDoubleClick : Triggered when an action is doubleClicked . 
- onMouseEnter : Triggered when mouse pointer enters the element .
- onMouseLeave : Triggered when mouse pointer leaves the element .
2) Keyboard Events:
- onKeyDown : Triggered when a key is pressed down .
- onKeyPress : Triggered when a key is pressed and held down .
- onKeyUp : Triggered when a key is released .
3) Form Events :
- onChange : Triggered when the value of an element changes .
- onSubmit : Triggered when a form is submitted .
- onInput : Triggered when the value of an input element is changed .
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// Define a React component named ClickButton
class ClickButton extends Component {

  // Define a method to handle the click event
  handleClick = () => {

    // Display an alert when the button is clicked
    alert('Button was clicked!');
  }

  // Render method to output the component's UI
  render() {
    return (
      // Button element with an onClick event handler
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click Me
      </button>
    );
  }
}

// Export the component so it can be used in other parts of the application
export default ClickButton;
```
In the above code whenever a button is clicked it shows an alert stating that button was clicked .

### Difference between State Management and Event Handling 

| Aspect       |           State Management                    |          Event Handling                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|Definition    | Managing state or data of a component         | Capturing and responing to user action |
|Purpose       | To maintain and update Data                   | Allow Components to interact with Ui   |
|Typical Usage | Keeping tracks of form inputs , Toggling UI   | Responding to button Clicks ,  form    |
|              | elements , storing fetched Data               | submissions , Mouse movements          |
|Key Methods   | 'useState', 'setState', 'useReducer'          | Different Event Handler Methods        |
|Trigger       | events , timers , network responses           | Clicks , key presses , Mouse events    | 


## Hooks 
Hooks is an important concept in react and were added in react version 16.8 . Hooks are special functions that let you use state and other react features in functional components and make it easier to manage state and other effects .   
After hooks use of Class components decreased because hooks allow us to use features of class components in functional components making the code look clean 

Commonly Used Hooks

   - useState: Manages state in a functional component.
   - useEffect: Performs side effects in a functional component, like fetching data or directly interacting with the DOM.
   - useContext: Accesses context values.
   - useReducer: Manages more complex state logic.
   - useRef: Accesses DOM elements or keeps mutable variables.

Example of hook with help of useState
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Custom hook to manage true or false state also known as boolean stage
// This custom hook manages a boolean state (value). It initializes the state with the provided initialValue (either true or false). 
// It also provides a toggle function to switch the boolean value between true and false.
function useToggle(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  // Function to toggle the boolean value
  const toggle = () => {
    setValue(!value);
  };

  // Return the boolean value and the toggle function
  return [value, toggle];
}


// Example component using the custom hook
function ToggleButton() {
  // Use the custom hook to get the boolean state and toggle function
  const [isOn, toggleIsOn] = useToggle(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Toggle: {isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleIsOn}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ToggleButton;
```
Output will be if you run the ToggleButton component provided, the output will be a toggle button displayed on the webpage. Initially, the text will show "Toggle: OFF" and there will be a button labeled "Toggle". When you click the "Toggle" button, the text will change between "Toggle: ON" and "Toggle: OFF" each time you click it, indicating the state of the toggle.

**Hook Rules** -
- Hooks can be only called inside React function components
- Hooks can only be called at top level of components
- Hooks cannot be conditional 

### Custom Hooks 
Custom hooks are user-defined functions in React that utilize one or more built-in React hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic. Custom hooks follow the naming convention of starting with "use" to enable them to leverage React's hook system. They allow developers to extract common logic from components and share it across multiple components. Custom hooks are not built-in; developers create them according to their specific needs.

### Basic difference betweeen State and Hooks 
State is a way to store information in react component that can change over time when components are updated while hooks are special functions provided by React that enable us to use React features, like state, context, and more in function components . Before hooks, these features were only available in class components

## React Router 
React Router is yet another important library for routing in react and enables navigation from one page to another or from one component to another . React Router changes the browser URL and shows the page which is specified in givenn URL .  
Main advantage of using React router is that React Router helps in creating single-page applications with navigation and multiple views without the need for refreshing the page.This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. It also enables more dynamic user experiences with things like animation.


### Note 
There were many changes made when react router was shifted from react-router v5 to v6 . 
This documentation contains information for react router v6

### How to install React Router
Run the below command in your terminal 
```
npm i react-router-dom 
```

### Main Components of React Router are :-

- BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API(pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.
- Routes: It’s a new component introduced in the v6 and an upgrade of the component. The main advantages of Routes over Switch Routes are chosen based on the best match instead of being traversed in order.
- Route: Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.
- Link: The link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like an HTML anchor tag.

Example of React Router in React JS

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import {
    BrowserRouter as Router,
    Routes,
    Route,
    Link,
} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./component/home";
import About from "./component/about";
import Contact from "./component/contact";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <Router>
                <div className="App">
                    <ul className="App-header">
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/about">
                                About Us
                            </Link>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <Link to="/contact">
                                Contact Us
                            </Link>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <Routes>
                        <Route
                            path="/"
                            element={<Home />}
                        ></Route>
                        <Route
                            path="/about"
                            element={<About />}
                        ></Route>
                        <Route
                            path="/contact"
                            element={<Contact />}
                        ></Route>
                    </Routes>
                </div>
            </Router>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
```
The above code shows different route which takes us to different elements. When going from one page to another the whole page does not get loaded again and only the components which are required are loaded which makes the webpage more efficient.
