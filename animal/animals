Create React App
To learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

This tutorial uses the create-react-app.

The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

Node.js is required to use create-react-app.

Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:

npx create-react-app my-react-app
create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

Note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app. To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.

Run the React Application
Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:

cd my-react-app
Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:

npm start
A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.

The result:
